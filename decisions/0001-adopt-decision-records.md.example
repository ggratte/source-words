# Adopt Decision Records

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Scope:** Architecture
**Tags:** documentation, decisions, process

## Context

As the codebase grows, we make decisions that shape its direction - choosing technologies, establishing patterns, setting priorities. These decisions and their rationale often exist only in memory or scattered conversations.

When revisiting code months later, or when onboarding new contributors, the "why" behind choices is lost. This leads to:
- Reopening settled decisions
- Making inconsistent choices
- Losing valuable context about trade-offs considered

We need a lightweight way to capture decisions with their context.

## Decision

We will adopt a decision records system based on Architecture Decision Records (ADR).

Decisions will be:
- Stored in `decisions/` as numbered markdown files
- Immutable once accepted (supersede rather than edit)
- Categorized by scope: Architecture, UX, or Product-Direction
- Tagged for discoverability

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Historical context preserved for future reference
- AI assistants can read decisions for better suggestions
- New contributors can understand past choices
- Reduces repeated discussions about settled topics

**Negative:**
- Small overhead to document decisions
- Risk of becoming stale if not maintained
- May over-document trivial choices initially

**Mitigations:**
- Keep the template lightweight
- Only document decisions worth explaining
- Supersede outdated decisions rather than letting them rot
